										<h2>Page Turners</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Book reading is a tradition that is increasingly becoming a thing of the past. In our fast-paced technology fuelled lives, where is the time to kick off our boots and settle down smugly with a nice book? But book lovers will know the joy of reading a good book, the thrill with which each page is flipped, the tears and laughter captured within those pages, and the profound knowledge they can impart. It's time we rekindled the book culture by sharing the books we possess with each other. </p>

										<h2>Book Club</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We all have moments when we wish for someone to hear all our feelings about Octavia Butler over a cup of coffee. Whenever we read a good book, we spend every waking moment wanting to talk about that book. That’s where a “Book Club” comes in, especially now when we have to look for things to do to break out of the monotony of the lockdown. Be a part of a crowd where you can share your heart out about the books you find repose in and listen from others how it made them feel. </p>
